# RMPJ

The RMPJ is an ImageJ plugin that implements operations based on rotational morphological processing (RMP), a variation of mathematical morphology. This plugin was primarily developed to process biomedical images, and can be used to enhance the delicate structures of biological objects with low contrast, remove noise and artifacts while preserving the delicate structures of biological samples, and separate and extract aggregated particulate structures.  

This plugin comprises seven RMP-based operations: *opening*, *closing*, *white top-hat*, *black top-hat*, *morphological smoothing*, and *two morphological contrast enhancements*.  

For details, please refer to the user manual provided in this repository.
